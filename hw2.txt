1) HTML structural components, such as headers, paragraphs, and lists, define the basic structure and layout of a webpage. Semantic HTML elements give content context by conveying both meaning and structure. Several elements, such as <article>, <nav>, and <footer>, represent certain types of content outside their structural role.
2) Using correct HTML elements ensures a clear and standardized structure and also promotes a consistent interpretation of content across different browsers and devices.
3) HTML forms are used to collect user input, such as text, selections, or buttons. They enable interaction on websites by allowing users to submit data, make selections, and perform various actions. Forms are used whenever user input is required, like login forms, search boxes, registration forms, and feedback forms.
4)Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. Examples include <span>, <a>, and <strong>. Block elements start on a new line and span the full width of their container. Examples include <div>, <p>, and <h1>.
