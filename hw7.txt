PHP and JavaScript are both languages for programing that are often used in web development. They are able to execute functions on both servers and clients, including submissions of data through forms and interaction with databases. Despite the differences, both languages cater to the creation of dynamic and interactive web pages. PHP is pre-eminently a server side scripting language, which is executed on the server before the HTML is sent to the designated browser, hence rendering it as a client side scripting language which is executed on the browser simultaneously. PHP is commonly used for server side-functions like server-logic and database interactions whereas the JavaScript is used for client side functions like document object manipulation and user interactions.
